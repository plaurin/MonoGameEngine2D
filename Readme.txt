MonoGameEngine2D

As the name state the obvious, I'll stick to features:
- Developer focus game engine
- 2D tile maps, sprites and hex based grid
- Camera controls
- Input mapping abstraction
- Entities and game logic (WIP)
- Debugging tooling: scene navigator, object inspector (WIP)

Wishlist:
- Audio
- Platform agnostic engine so that it could be used not only with XNA
- Sheets and Maps designer tool
- Maybe network
